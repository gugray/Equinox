Coming up:
================================================
OK multi-step pipeline: position; then luminance
OK with multi-step pipeline: hatching approaches (in cpu first)
OK overlay 2d canvas to visualize 3d vector fields
OK controls
-- Unify JS and Zig hatcher params, incl. short line filter
-- Put camera params into uniforms
-- Mouse control on canvas
-- Extract texture straight to WASM buffer
-- Toggle hatcher: JS or Zig
-- Animate

Research / longer term:
================================================
-- read up on: principal curvature
-- SDFs and refraction
-- render aist dancers with sdfs
-- play more with shape composition and distortion
-- rando distro shading SDF surfaces: point dithering; lines
-- per-frame render + moviefy w/ffmpeg
